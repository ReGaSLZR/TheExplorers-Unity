  m_question: Why is saving the rainforest so important?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: "Without it, we wouldn\u2019t have any rain or forests."
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: The rainforests are like the lungs of the planet.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  - m_choiceValue: Polar bears live there.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: "It produces most of the world\u2019s oil supply."
    m_isCorrect: 0
  m_explanation: "Rainforests act like our body\u2019s lungs by taking in carbon dioxide,
    a gas that is bad for humans, and producing oxygen which we all need to survive.
    Also, as one of the largest and oldest forests on the planet, the life found there
    and the systems that work there are unlike any others in our known universe. Unfortunately,
    the world's rainforests are vanishing because the trees are being cut. Nearly
    6000 acres are cut every hour, which is about the size of 4000 football fields
    an hour!"
