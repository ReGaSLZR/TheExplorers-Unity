    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Use fewer of the products made from trees, such as paper, napkins,

    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: "Companies who purchase trees to make their products will stop using
    as many trees if people stop buying their products. Anything made from paper has
    come from a tree. If you have to use a paper product, try to use recycled paper.
    While we haven\u2019t found a complete substitute for using trees to make paper
    products, we can try to use less of them. This means that fewer trees will be
    cut down."
