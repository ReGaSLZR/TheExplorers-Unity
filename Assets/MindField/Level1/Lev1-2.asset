  m_explanation: "Rainforests play many important roles for the Earth and life upon
    it. One big contribution is to the Earth\u2019s climate. The rainforest does this
    by cleaning the air of carbon dioxide, or greenhouse gases, that can cause the
    Earth to overheat. Rainforests also affect weather conditions and by making the
    overall temperature of the planet healthy. This is why cutting down the trees
    in the rainforest is bad for everyone."
