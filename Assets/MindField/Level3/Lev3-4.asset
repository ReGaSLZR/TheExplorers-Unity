  m_question: What do camels store in their humps?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Water
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Food
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Venom
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Fat.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: When camels go for long periods without food or water the fat in
    their humps converts to water and food within their bodies. This incredible ability
    has allowed camels to live for thousands of years in the desert. They can go for
    months without eating or drinking if they have to!
