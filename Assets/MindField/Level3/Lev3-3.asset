  m_question: Which of the following are humans NOT doing to protect the camels?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Building homes.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Destroying existing oasis.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Hunting camels or shooting them as pests.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Setting up of camel preserves where they can live peacefully.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: A combination of factors are pushing the Bactrian camel towards extinction.
    Human impact on an already harsh environment continue to make it difficult for
    camels to find enough food, water and shelter to survive. Domestic animals, such
    as cattle and horses, compete with camels for the sparse grasslands available
    near the oasis.
