  m_question: "Which of the following do NOT contribute to the Bactrian camel\u2019s
    threatened existence?"
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Use by farmers.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  - m_choiceValue: For food.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Wolves at watering holes.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Drought.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  m_explanation: Many farmers use them as domestic animals and treat them kindly.
    However, many of the watering holes, where wolves lie in wait, cause great damage
    to wild camel herds. Hunters and the continued prolonged droughts also mean that
    unless something changes soon, there will be no more camels in the wild in the
    next 50 years.
