  m_question: Which of the following does NOT contribute to the tigers' threatened
    existence?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Chinese medicine production.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Increased farming.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Continued study of tigers in the wild.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  - m_choiceValue: Poaching for their skins.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  m_explanation: Scientists continue to study wild tigers but it has become increasingly
    difficult to find them. Many researchers believe that tigers will have to adapt
    to live in different habitats in order to survive. This may mean that in the future
    you may see tigers living in the desert or in snow covered mountains. Some already
    are living this way.
