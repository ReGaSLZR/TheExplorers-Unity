  m_question: How much of the natural habitat for tigers in Asia has been lost?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: 10%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 75%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 30%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 95%
    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: "95% means that nearly all of the tiger\u2019s original habitat is
    now gone. Tigers are considered apex predators and keep other species under control.
    They keep areas from disease and plants from growing out of control. Without tigers,
    prey animals would overpopulate areas and bring disease to humans. The prey, if
    left unchecked, would also devastate vegetation that keeps erosion from occurring
    and produces the oxygen we breathe. When we protect tigers, much more is protected."
