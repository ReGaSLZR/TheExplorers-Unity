  m_question: How much of the natural habitat for tigers in Asia has been lost?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: 10%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 30%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 75%
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: 95%
    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: "95% means that nearly all of the tiger\u2019s original habitat is
    now gone. Tigers are considered apex predators and keep other species under control.
    They keep the area from disease and plants from growing out of control. Without
    tigers, prey animals would overpopulate areas and bring disease to humans. The
    prey animals, if left unchecked, would also devastate vegetation that keeps erosion
    from occurring and produces the oxygen we breathe. When tigers are protected,
    much more is protected at the same time."
