  m_question: How do cities, many miles away from the ocean, cause reef death?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: By not doing anything.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Polluting waterways that make their way to the ocean.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  - m_choiceValue: They employ the workers who are killing the reefs.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: They do not enact laws to protect the reefs.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  m_explanation: While all of the choices have an element of truth in them, the largest
    contribution by anyone not living near the ocean is the amount of pollution that
    finds its way into the waterways. Most waterways lead to the ocean, eventually.
