  m_question: Which of the following are also practices that contribute to coral reef
    death?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Conservation.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Restrictions on diving near coral reefs.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Research.
    m_isCorrect: 0
  - m_choiceValue: Selling corals to tourists.
    m_isCorrect: 1
  m_explanation: Not only are live corals sold as souvenirs to tourists in different
    parts of the world, they are also removed to be used as cement for buildings,
    used as bricks or for filling in potholes on roads. There are other, better, materials
    to do this with, so there is no need to ruin the reefs for such activity.
