  m_question: How can one person make a difference to the coral reefs?
  m_choices:
  - m_choiceValue: Speak up and do not support those companies who contribute to reef
      death.

  - m_choiceValue: Read a lot.

  m_explanation: If each person made a point to limit the use of sunscreens that have
    oxybenzone, which is lethal to reefs, then it would be a start. Saying something,
    making sure that those in charge understand that you are not okay with this happening
    is when change and protection begin to take place on a larger scale.
